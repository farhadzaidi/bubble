The docker compose file in this directory is used to create a Docker container
which contains a MySQL image. This is meant to make development easier by avoiding
the headaches associated with different MySQL configurations on different systems.

You only need docker installed on your system to make this work and it should work
on virtually any machine.

The schema.sql file is the file that Docker uses to populate the database with
the schema (tables and triggers). 

Note that this schema is meant for development use only. In production, the 
databases should be split into separate MySQL containers with stricter user 
privileges for security.
