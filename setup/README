The 'setup.sh' script in this directory is used to setup the MySQL database
and environment variables for DEVELOPMENT.

You can run it with 'sudo ./setup.sh' in this directory.
The script requires MySQL to be installed on your machine.
Note: The database setup uses sudo for root user authentication, if you're
using a separate root password, make sure to add the -p flag to each mysql
command.

The script will do the following:

- Database Setup
  - Create a 'bubble_dev' database on the local machine
  - Create a user named 'dev' with full privileges to this database (password: dev)
  - Create all the tables needed for the app to work
  - Populate these tables with some dummy data for testing
- Environment Setup
  - Create a '.env' file with the required environment variables for the app to work

Once again, this is only meant for use in DEVELOPMENT.
