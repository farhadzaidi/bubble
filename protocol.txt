Bubble employs end-to-end encryption and disappearing messages.
By default all messages disappear after 24 hours. This TTL can be changed.

---- Protocol ----

- Upon connection, the client will send a GREET payload with their username
  - The server will respond with a STATE_SYNC payload which will consist of MESSAGE payloads retreived from the database
- Event: Sender sends the server a MESSAGE payload
  - The server stores the message in the database
  - The MESSAGE payload is forwarded to each recipient that is currently online

*Clients will sort messages by timestamp before displaying
*The server will periodically query the database for messages that have been expired and delete them from the database. If the corresponding
clients are online, the server will send a DELETE payload to each of them with the ids of said messages
